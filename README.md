# Library-Management-System-
This Java OOP-based Library Management System manages books and users. It allows adding books/users, viewing lists, issuing and returning books, and tracks availability. Uses `Book`, `User`, and `Library` classes with `ArrayList` storage, and a menu-driven interface in `Main` for user interaction via `Scanner`.
